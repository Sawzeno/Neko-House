# Neko House (Under Construction)

I wanted to make my own Navmesh-like library to both learn game-ai and see what more improvemrnts are pssible in case of a custom AI lib for NPC's 

## Aims :
make a simulation of cats and see how close to reality we can get with their behaviour and movements

## Current State :
can place objects here and there
